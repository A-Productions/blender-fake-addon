# Blender - pytest - TravisCI integration

The code to shows how the `pytest` can be used inside blender to test an addon.  Once a checkin has been performed TravisCI runs the tests on the current nightly builds for blender 2.79 and 2.8.

## Motivation

I have been around python for the better part of 10 years now.  Python is only just coming of that painful period of time when it transitioned from python2 to python3.  We got there, yay!

I have been playing around with blender for 3-4 years and the move to blender 2.80 from 2.79 is beginning to look very similar.

One obvious area of concern is that the addon used in blender are hardly ever written with any tests.  If some thing was written for 2.56 it may or may not work for 2.65. It usually did so that has allowed some great work to live on.  Hoever the move to 2.80 is really beginning to flag where we suffer for lack of regressable tests.

My new years resolution (2019) was to at least see if I could put together a decent test frame work that could allow for regressable tests, on multiple builts of blender, and have it feed into a continous integration tool, in this case TravisCI that can run against the nightly builds.  

I have also picked pytest as I have experience with this from my day job as and microchip validation engineer.  And it is non standard enough the work here shows how you can get any python module you want into blender.

## pytest

Blender comes with it own version of python.  When you run blender the python it uses is this one not one that has been installed on you system.  The python that blender somes with has `unittest` as a standard module.  `unittest` is a bit long in the tooth, `pytest` has started to become a lot more popular in the industry. So two things are missing that we need to get, `pip` and `pytest`.  

To install `pip` you need to fetch `get-pip.py` from this path:

`wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py`

and then we explictly call the python inside blender to install `pip`:

`blender/2.79/python/bin/python3.7m get-pip.py`

this will install `pip` locally that when called will install modules into the blender version of python and not the system.

*linux*: `blender/2.79/python/bin/pip`

*windows*: `blender\2.79\python\Scripts\pip`

we use this `pip` to install pytest:

`blender/2.79/python/bin/pip install pytest`

You will now be able to import pytest inside python scripts called by blender.

## fake-addon

The addon included here is the most basic addon possible.  All it does is print out a message when it is installed and another one when it is removed.  However all addons have required to have version tuple.  This version can be read back through blender.  This is the test we use:

```
    expect_version = (0, 0, 1)
    return_version = get_version(bpy_module)
    assert  expect_version == return_version
```

In the current release, there are two tests, one to check that the right value gets returned and one to check if the wrong value returned is detected correctly.  These pass.  If you wish to see a correct failure under pytest, changed the `expect_version` value to something it should now be.

During the `pytest` `configure` phase the helper scripts have been written to handle the zipping of the addon into a zip file, which is then imported into blender.  If this import was unsuccessfuly the `get_version()` would error, which would be captured by `pytest`.

The `unconfigure` removes the `addon` from the `scripts/addon` directory used by blender . 

## Run tests locally

To run the test locally you need to have a version of blender present. Since these scripts were written to work on multiple revisions of blender at the same time, your standard unzips should got here accordingly:

2.79 : `blender_build/blender_2.79`
2.80 : `blender_build/blender_2.80`
